			<h4><u>My Hackathon Experience:</u></h4>
		<p>Two weeks ago, I participated my very first <b>Hackathon</b>. 
		Around a month ago my big brother <b>Manobendronath Biswas</b>
		 told <b>The National BDapps Hackathon</b> organized by <b>Robi</b>.
		  <br>
		  The hackathon was around 1 days long. 
		  I pretty much dedicated most of my time to this hackathon for a week. 
		  There would be investors among the judges, so we were building a project
		  Named <b>Code With BOB</b>
		  There were many highly quailified judges. They were all University Lecturer or 
		  Professors.They gave me many ideas and prayed for my bright future . I also met with 
		  many other participents. They were all university students. I learnt many things from them.
		  <br>
		  At evening the Hackathon results were announched and we were #5. The moment was very special for
		  me. It a very pround moment also. I can't forgot the day.
